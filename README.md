# IMDB-Movie
Designed and developed a dynamic Power BI dashboard to analyze IMDB movie data across genre, director, rating, revenue, and metascore. Implemented Row-Level Security (RLS) based on film ratings, created calculated DAX measures (Revenue per Minute, Rating Category), and used drillthrough pages and bookmarks to enhance interactivity.
